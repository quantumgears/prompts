>The given text is a rider attached to an enrollment application for a Certificate of Coverage. The rider outlines the terms and conditions of additional coverage for inpatient mental health services. This coverage is provided by Blue Care Network (BCN), an affiliate of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Michigan. The premium for the rider is due on the same date as the regular certificate premium and must be remitted to BCN. In case the coverage under the Certificate of Coverage terminates, the rider automatically terminates without any further action or notice by BCN. This means that all other provisions of the Certificate of Coverage remain unchanged except for the coverage provided by this rider. Under this rider, policyholders are covered for inpatient treatment up to 30 days per calendar year. Treatment must be provided in a BCN-approved facility, and only conditions that are not chronic and are likely to show significant improvement during the admission are covered. Additionally, acute episodes related to chronic conditions and partial-day inpatient programs are covered. It is important to note that this rider only applies to mental health inpatient treatment and does not cover all types.

>**User:** Based on the document, how is partial day inpatient care defined?

>**QS-LLM Fast:** 
>
>Based on the document, partial day inpatient care is defined as a type of inpatient care that is covered when pre-approved by BCN. Two days of partial-day inpatient care will be counted as the equivalent of one day of inpatient hospital benefit, and the inpatient mental health benefit will be decreased by one day for every two days of partial-day inpatient care. However, the given portion of the document does not specify if partial day inpatient programs are covered or provide any other information about partial day inpatient care.

>**QS-LLM Fast:** 
>
>Based on this document, the reason for the maximum cap on mental health treatment is to limit the amount of out-of-pocket expenses that an individual or contract can incur for mental health treatment during a calendar year. The maximum amount allowed is $1,000 per individual or $2,000 per contract.

>The provided portion of the document highlights certain limitations and requirements for mental health treatment coverage, which differentiate it from typical mental health coverage in standard health insurance plans. Compared to standard plans, the coverage in this document includes a maximum annual copayment of $1,000 per individual or $2,000 per contract, which is separate from the medical annual copayment maximum. This means that the amount an individual or contract can pay out-of-pocket for mental health services is limited. Additionally, coverage is limited to conditions that are not chronic and are likely to show significant improvement during the admission, and treatment must be provided in a BCN approved facility. This document also specifies that all other provisions of the Certificate pertaining to Mental Health remain unchanged, meaning that the coverage for mental health services is the same as the coverage for medical services under the standard health insurance plan. However, the document mentions specific limitations such as inpatient treatment being limited to 30 days per calendar year and covering partial-day inpatient programs only if pre-approved by BCN. Overall, the coverage in this document differs from typical mental health coverage in standard health insurance plans in terms of specific limitations and requirements that may apply, and it's important to note that the full coverage details may vary. The coverage details mentioned in the document are clearly not the same as that conveyed in a standard health insurance plan.
