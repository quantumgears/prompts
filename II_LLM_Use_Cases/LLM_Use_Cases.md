## II. LLM Use Cases

In this section, we will show some of the common uses of LLMs. The first section will deal with the "free chat" and the second section will deal with the "document chat."

Free chat means that the user is interacting directly with the LLM. Any context required for the task is sent directly with the request (e.g., pasting text to be summarized). It is opposed to the document chat, in which each request is accompanied by a document. 

In the document chat, the LLM first analyzes a provided document and keeps it in its memory before the chat begins. The document chat augments a userâ€™s ability to quickly analyze a document. For this section, we recommend you have the document open in another window to quickly reference and check the LLM output.
