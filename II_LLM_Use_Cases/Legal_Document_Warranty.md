Based on this document, can you elaborate on the definition of a 'Residential Purchaser' as per this warranty document?
```
>**QS-LLM Fast:** 
>
>Based on this document, a "Residential Purchaser" under this Limited Warranty is defined as a person who purchases and installs the Product in a dwelling that is owned and used by that person as a primary or secondary home, or any person or business such as a builder, contractor or developer that purchases and installs the Product in a newly constructed or remodeled dwelling that will be used by the initial owner/purchaser of that dwelling as a primary or secondary home. In such situation, this Limited Warranty may be assigned to the initial owner/purchaser who uses the dwelling as a primary or secondary home. Additionally, a consumer subject to the Quebec Consumer Protection Act is also considered a Residential Purchaser under this warranty document. In summary, a "Residential Purchaser" refers to an individual or entity who purchases a product for use as their primary or secondary home. The warranty period for the product begins on the date of purchase and is only valid if the dwelling is used as a primary or secondary home. The warranty does not extend to future owners if the property is sold. The definition of a "Residential Purchaser" is clear and specific, based on the provided portion of the document. I can therefore provide a high level of confidence (CONFIDENCE_SCORE = 90%) that my answer is accurate.

```

>Based on this document, the inclusion of both a 'Limited Lifetime Warranty' and specific shorter warranty periods for certain components suggests that the manufacturer has varying levels of confidence in the overall quality and durability of their products. The 'Limited Lifetime Warranty' may indicate a higher level of confidence in the overall quality and durability of their products, while the shorter warranty periods for certain components suggest areas where the manufacturer is less confident in their product's performance.
