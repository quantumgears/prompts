>The document proposes a modification to the Simple Blue HSA Group Benefits Certificate with Prescription Drugs ASC, which is an account held by Sapa Precision Tubing Adrian Inc. [We are uncertain about the reason for the modification, no changes are specified in the provided portion of the document]. The modification aims to change the coverage for chiropractic services, outpatient visits, physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech-language pathology. The maximum number of visits for chiropractic spinal manipulations and osteopathic manipulative therapy has been increased from 12 to 24 per member per calendar year, which applies to both in-network and out-of-network providers. The maximum number of visits for physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech-language pathology is also increased from 30 to 60 combined visits, which also applies to both in-network and out-of-network outpatient visits, regardless of location. The document also includes a note stating that since this group is self-funded under an ASC arrangement, a rider for this modification will not be filed with the Michigan Department of Insurance and Financial Services.

>How does the ASC Plan Modification 8656 change the coverage for chiropractic services and osteopathic manipulative therapy, and what could be the potential impact on members' health benefits?

>The ASC Plan Modification 8656 changes the coverage for chiropractic services and osteopathic manipulative therapy by increasing the maximum number of visits per member, per calendar year from 12 to 24. This modification also increases the maximum for chiropractic spinal manipulations and osteopathic manipulative therapy to 24 combined visits per member, per calendar year, allowing visits with in-network and out-of-network providers to count toward the maximum. The potential impact on members' health benefits could be positive as they may receive more treatments that could improve their overall health and well-being. However, this modification may also result in higher costs for the plan sponsor and potentially higher premiums for members. Members may need to carefully manage their visits to ensure they don't exceed the maximum limit.

>The changes in the ASC Plan Modification 8656 may reflect broader trends in health care benefits management, particularly in relation to high-deductible health plans like the Simply Blue HSA, by increasing the maximum for chiropractic spinal manipulations and osteopathic manipulative therapy, expanding coverage for chiropractic services, increasing the maximum number of visits allowed for chiropractic spinal manipulations and osteopathic manipulative therapy, and increasing the maximum number of outpatient visits for physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech and language pathology. These changes may reflect a growing demand for alternative and complementary health services, a recognition of the importance of preventive care and alternative therapies in managing overall health and reducing healthcare costs, a shift towards more consumer-driven healthcare, a growing emphasis on value-based care and member-centered decision-making, and an effort to provide more comprehensive coverage for certain types of services while encouraging members to choose cost-effective options.

>As an Employee Wellness Coordinator, the increased coverage for therapies can be integrated into the broader wellness initiatives by promoting the use of these therapies as part of a comprehensive wellness program. To maximize employee health outcomes, it is important to conduct a needs assessment to identify the specific needs and concerns of the employees, develop a wellness plan aligned with the company's overall mission, communicate the plan to all employees, provide access to therapies as part of the wellness plan, and educate employees on the benefits and proper use of these therapies.

>To accommodate the increased visit limits for physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech and language pathology, as well as chiropractic spinal manipulations, osteopathic manipulative therapy, and other services, the following administrative changes may need to be implemented:
>
>1. Update the member's visit limit: The system or database that tracks the member's visits should be updated to reflect the new maximum of 60 combined outpatient visits per member, per calendar year.
>2. Notify providers: Providers should be notified of the increased visit limits and informed of any changes to their authorization or reimbursement rates.
>3. Implement utilization monitoring: The plan should monitor utilization of the increased visit limits to ensure that they are being used appropriately and effectively.
>4. Implement prior authorization: Prior authorization may be required for certain services or procedures to ensure that the increased visit limits are being used appropriately.
>5. Review and update policies: The plan's policies regarding outpatient services may need to be reviewed and updated to reflect the new visit limits.
>6. Provide training to network providers: Providers should be trained on the new visit limits and any associated requirements or guidelines.
